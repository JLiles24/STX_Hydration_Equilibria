# STX_Hydration_Equilibria
DFT calculations for Gibbs free energy of ketone hydration (dG_hydration) model across a series of saxitoxin (STX) derivatives (collaboration with the Looper Lab, University of Utah).
- All energies reported in kcal/mol
- Final models built with dG_hydration for STX set to 0.00 kcal/mol (relative hydration energies with respect to STX).
- Low energy conformers (LECs can be found in the original SI)
